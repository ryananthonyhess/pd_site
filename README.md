# pd_site
This is my project for Code Louisville's front end web development class.
I used the bootstrap framework to re-do page by page my current employers website. 
On each page there is a link to the original page that has been redone in the jumbotron.
The find my courtdate feature is something I'd like to work on learning how to implement but currently it's only function is to display an alert message on click.
This project is a work in progress.
